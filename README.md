Micro Frontend: The future is here and easier than you think

Microservices have helped revolutionize how we build our backends. Gone are the days of multiple development teams working on a single monolithic backend that spans many domains with high coupling, bad scalability, slow feature development, difficult merge conflicts, highly coordinated deployments, and the like. Meanwhile, our frontends now face many of these same issues. Micro frontend is the solution and future of frontend software development.

In this session, Jason will help demystify the micro frontend architecture patterns. He will provide insights based on first-hand experience transitioning a product away from a monolithic frontend over the past few years. Finally, he’ll conclude with a live technical demo where he’ll build a micro frontend architecture from scratch using Module Federation with Angular. By the end of this session, you will realize that this isn’t as complicated as you may think.
